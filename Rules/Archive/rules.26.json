An entity entering a dungeon or level has their turn placed after the previous last element of their entity type (ie. player, minotaur, etc.). Should an entity leave the dungeon or level they are removed from the list and no longer have a turn in that dungeon or level.\nIf a player does not move within 24 hours of their turn commencing, they forfeit their turn (do nothing).",
