Should an entity leave the dungeon or level they are removed from the list and no longer have a turn in that dungeon or level.\nIf a player does not move within 24 hours of their turn commencing, they forfeit their turn (do nothing). \n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Minotaur > Movement*\nA minotaur cannot move into pool, chest, minotaur and pit dungeon hexes or end a turn on the centre dungeon hex d:(0,0,h).\nA minotaur will target players, acting to move into their hex.\nWhen a minotaur has its turn, it will act in one of 4 ways; charging, leaping, random movement or no movement.\nIf a minotaur does not perform any of the first 3, it does not move (no movement).\nWhen a minotaur enters the hex of a stone wall or steel wall, that dungeon hex is replaced by the blank dungeon hex. A minotaur can exist in dark, cobwebs or switch dungeon hexes.\n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Minotaur > Movement > Charging*\nIf there is a path from the minotaur to a player (perpendicular to the edges of its dungeon hex), it will charge at the player, moving 3 hexes (in one turn) in that direction or until entering the hex of a stone wall, steel wall or player (or stopping due to being unable to move into the desired hex).\nFor multiple eligable players, it will target the closest player.\n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Minotaur > Movement > Leaping*\nAlternatively, if a player cannot be targeted, there is a 30% chance that it will leap to a player's dungeon hex (random). It remains airborne for its turn (then landing for the following turn). (The minotaur effectively skips 2 turns.) If a player moves from their dungeon hex after a minotaur leaps, the minotaur lands on the hex where they were at the time of leaping.\nA minotaur will not leap onto a hex with another minotaur, and attempting to do so causes the leap destination to be determined again. \n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Minotaur > Movement > Random Movement*\nIf a minotaur does not leap when a player cannot be targeted, there is a 50% chance that it will move randomly. When this occurs, a random valid direction is chosen such that the minotaur can move into the adjacent hex in that direction. It then does so. \n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Pit*\nIf a player enters a pit dungeon hex, they immediately fall into a deeper level of the dungeon, being placed at the centre d:(0,0,h) of a 'new dungeon' that is a subset of the previous, with h increased by 1. This is generated when a player enters a pit.\n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Pit > Locked*\nWhen a pit generates, there is a 40% chance that it is locked. Players cannot move onto a locked pit dungeon hex.\nA player adjacent to a locked pit may use a Dungeon Key (removing 1 from their inventory) if they have at least 1 to remove the lock. \n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Switch*\nWhilst an entity occupies the same hex as a switch, that switch is active. If all switches on a level are active any locked pit dungeon hexes are temporarily unlocked (for as long as all switches are active).\n\n**Addition**\n> *World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Entering*\nA player can enter a dungeon once per period.\nWhen a player enters a dungeon they are placed on the centre hex.\nA player can leave a dungeon at any time, removing them and placing them back on the hex with the associated Dungeon landmark in the World.\nWhilst a player is inside a dungeon, the traverse action costs 0 action points for them, though players must move in single steps. \n\n**Addition**\n> *5.2.3.8 - Dungeon*\nIf a player uses the work action on a hex with a Dungeon landmark, they work as an archeologist and earn 550*~~m~~*. A player working on any dungeon hex inside a dungeon receives the same reward. \n\n**Content Edit**\nThe following replaces the table in *7.3.5*.\n[Table] \n\n**Content Edit**\n> *Construction > Pylon of Purity*\nResource Cost: 100× Wood, 20× Steel, 5× Gold\nCannot be constructed on lake hexes.\nAll adjacent hexes and the hex of the pylon of purity cannot be corrupted. Attempts to do so fail.\nWhen this landmark is constructed, any corrupted hexes adjacent to it are converted to their normal (uncorrupted) forms.\n\n**Content Edit**\n> *Construction > Stag Station*\nResource Cost: 50× Stone, 10× Steel\nCannot be constructed on lake hexes.\nA player located on a hex with the stag station landmark may travel the stagways (teleport) to any hex with the stag station landmark. This does not act as moving into that hex. If they do so, they cannot perform any more actions for the period and cannot move from this hex until the next period. \n\n**Edit**\n> *Construction > Bridge*\n**New Title:** *Boardwalk*\nResource Cost: 10× Wood\nA lake with a boardwalk landmark can be traversed onto and a player can fish targeting the hex they are on.\nAny other hex with the boardwalk landmark does not apply its status effect, penalty, etc.",

    "content": "**Content Edit**\n*5.3.2.3.1.1 - Dungeon Hexes*\nWhen a dungeon is generated, the type of all dungeon hexes except for the centre (blank) are determined for a random dungeon.\nA random (weighted) type is chosen:\n- Blank (Weight: 16 - h, for h<8, if h≥8, Weight: 4)\n- Dark (Weight: h² - h + 4)\n- Cobwebs (Weight: h² - 3h + 4)\n- Stone Wall (Weight: h² + 5)\n- Steel Wall (Weight: 2h + 3)\n- Pool (Weight: h + 1)\n- Chest (Weight: 2h + 1)\n- Minotaur (Weight: 2h - 2)\n- Pit (Weight: h + 2, if greater than 1 pit already on a level, Weight: h, if 3 pits have already generated on a level, Weight: 0)\n- Switch (Weight: 2)\nWhere 'h' refers to the depth of the dungeon, starting at 1 and succeeding with each nested pit.\nDungeon hexes cannot be corrupt. \n\n**Content Edit**\n> *5.3.2.3.1.1.6.1 - Loot*\nWhen a chest is opened, loot is generated depending on the depth that the chest is located in. Each chest contains the following:\n- 1× Tier h loot, or if h>5, tier 5 loot.\n- 1× Tier h - 1 loot, if h=1, Tier 1 loot, if h>5, tier 4 loot.\n- 1× Tier h - 3 loot, nothing if h=1, if h=2 or h=3, tier 1 loot, if h=4, tier 2 loot, if h>7, tier 4 loot.\n- If h>5, the number of the tier of the first loot item is subtracted from h and this number has 5 repeatedly subtracted until the value is less than 5. If at any point after this the value is zero, the proceeding subtractions are not applied. Then, 4 is subtracted unless less than 4, followed by 3 if greater than 2, 2 if greater than 1 and finally 1. The number of subtracted 5s is tier 5 loot items earned. If a 4 was subtracted, an additional tier 4 item is selected. Likewise a tier 3 item if 3 was, tier 2 for 2 and tier 1 for 1.\nWhen a loot item is selected, a random item from the list in *5.3.2.3.1.1.6.1.1 - Tiers* is determined for the appropriate tier.\n\n**Addition**\n> *5.3.2.3.1.1.6.1.1 - Tiers*\nTiered loot\nTier 5:\n2× Morbium \n\nTier 4:\n1× Morbium\n3× Gold\n2× Resin \n\nTier 3:\n12× Steel\n9× Steel\n5× Steel\n1× Resin\n5× Copper\n3× Copper\n1× Gold\n1× Gold\n1× Arcane Tome\n1× Dungeon Key\n1× Dungeon Key\n1× Sun Plate\n1× Moon Plate \n\nTier 2:\n16× Wood\n10× Stone\n6× Steel\n5× Steel\n2× Steel\n3× Thread\n3× Hide\n1× Hide\n4× Quartz\n3× Copper\n2× Copper\n1× Gold\n1× Pickaxe\n1× Dungeon Key\n1× Sun Plate\n1× Moon Plate\n1× Wheelbarrow\n1× Binoculars\n1× Periscope\n1× Classic Rod \n\nTier 1:\n7× Wood\n5× Stone\n3× Stone\n2× Steel\n1× Steel\n1× Thread\n1× Thread\n2× Hide\n1× Quartz\n1× Boulder\n1× Handline Reel \n\n**Content Edit**\n> *5.2.4.1.2.34 - Chest (Fish?)*\nChest (Fish?) Is a medallion fish that can be caught in pool dungeon hexes.\nA player may 'open' a Chest (Fish?) to gain chest loot as if h=3. This removes the Chest (Fish?) from their inventory.\n\n**Content Edit**\n> *5.3.2.3.1.1.7.1.1 - Turns*\nAll entities take turns to optionally perform an action in a dungeon or level. This does not occur if there are no players in a dungeon or level.\nOn each level (depth) of a dungeon, the turn order is the list in World > Generation > Landmarks > Dungeon > Generation > Dungeon Hexes > Minotaur > Entities (with relevant elements of each in order of their position left to right, top to bottom in the dungeon). An entity entering a dungeon or level has their turn placed after the previous last element of their entity type (ie. player, minotaur, etc.). Should an entity leave the dungeon or level they are removed from the list and no longer have a turn in that dungeon or level.\nIf a player does not move within 24 hours of their turn commencing, they forfeit their turn (do nothing). \n\n**Content Edit**\n> *5.3.2.3.1.1.7.2 - Movement*\nA minotaur cannot move into pool, minotaur and pit dungeon hexes or end a turn on the centre dungeon hex d:(0,0,h).\nA minotaur will target players, acting to move into their hex.\nWhen a minotaur has its turn, it will act in one of 4 ways; charging, leaping, random movement or no movement.\nIf a minotaur does not perform any of the first 3, it does not move (no movement).\nWhen a minotaur enters the hex of a stone wall or steel wall, that dungeon hex is replaced by the blank dungeon hex. \n\n**Content Edit**\n> *5.3.2.3.1.1.7.2.1 - Charging*\nIf there is a straight line of hexes from a minotaur to a player (perpendicular to the edges of its dungeon hex) and has no stone walls or steel walls between the player and minotaur, it will charge at the player, moving 3 hexes (in one turn) in that direction or until entering the dungeon hex of cobwebs (or stopping due to being unable to move into the desired hex).\nFor multiple eligable players, it will target the closest player.",
