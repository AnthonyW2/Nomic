An eligible voter may change their vote at any time before voting ends. \n\n--> 1.3.1.2.1 Propositions > Voting > Casting Votes > Leftvoting\nIn the event of a leftvote majority, the proponent must propose a modified version of their proposition within 72 hours of the proposition reaching leftvote majority. Failure to provide a modified proposition within this timeframe results in the proposition failing (equivalent to a downvote majority). \n\n--> 1.3.1.2.2 Propositions > Voting > Casting Votes > Rightvoting\nYou may abstain from voting by rightvoting. \n\n--> 1.3.1.4 Propositions > Voting > Ties\nIf the votes on a proposition result in a downvote majority or a tie between upvotes and downvotes for majority, the proposition is instead leftvote majority if the sum of upvotes and leftvotes votes is greater than the amount of downvotes.",
